Personal Computing on the VIC-20
A friendly computer guide  
(or "The VIC20 User Guide")

PREFACE
You are about to meet a friendly computer! Friendly in price,
friendly in size, friendly to use and learn on and experience.
Most important — you don't have to be a computer 
programmer, or even a typist, to use it!

If you're a first time computerist, this manual will provide an
excellent introduction to computing. Unlike most instruction 
manuals, you don't have to read through this whole book to get
to the "good stuff." After reading Chapter 1 (GETTING
STARTED), you can go directly to a chapter that interests you
and start reading. If you're interested in animation turn to
Chapter 4. If you like music, try Chapter 5.

The first page of each chapter has a sample program to start 
you off. Just type the program exactly as shown ("Try Typing
This Program") and see what happens. The rest of the chapter 
explains what you did, and shows you how to do more. Chapter
7 summarizes some important programming concepts, and
explains the techniques used in the sample programs. 

If you're an experienced programmer, you can use the VIC like
any microcomputer. Familiarity with Commodore computers
will help, since the BASIC and graphics are nearly identical to
those used in the PET/CBM. Advanced reference material and
programming information are included in the Appendix. For
more sophisticated programming, see the VIC PROGRAMMERS 
REFERENCE GUIDE, available from your Commodore dealer.

If you're a noncomputerist and have no interest in
programming, per se, you should check out the VIC's growing
library of plug-in cartridges and program tapes. VIC cartridges
plug directly into the back of the console and work
automatically. Programs are also provided on cassette tapes for
use with the Commodore Cassette Tape Recorder.

Cartridges and tapes include exciting "arcade-type" games
such as "VIC INVADERS" as well as educational programs to 
help you develop special skills, and home utility programs to
help you solve problems and perform calculations.

Peripherals and accessories for the VIC include the VIC tape
cassette recorder, single disk drive, telephone modem and
printer, to name a tew. (See Appendix A) 

Computers are becoming an increasingly important part of our
everyday lives — in our homes, at school and in business.
Those who become familiar with computers now will have an
important advantage in the coming months and years. The VIC 
not only introduces you to the world of computing, but also
gives you the features and flexibility you need to expand that
world.

Enjoy your new world!

UNPACKING AND CONNECTING THE VLC20

Welcome to computing! The following sfep-by-step instructions show you how
to unpack the VIC, connect it to /our television sel and make sure it's working
properly.

Let's begin by taking a quick
look at the VIC20:

1. Check the contents of your VIC container. You should find the
following items;
— VIC 20 Personal Computer
— Power Supply (large box with 2 cords coming out of it)
— RF Modulator (small metal box) and short cable*
— Video Cable

2. You will need 2 electrical outlets (sockets) — one for the VfC and
one for your television set.

3. Position the VfC and Television set so you can use the keyboard
comfortably while viewing the television screen...ideally, a tablelop
or desk.

4. Find the ON/OFF switch on
the rrght hand side of the VIC.
Make sure ifs in the "OFF"
position. (Diagram of right-side of VIC-20 showing ON/OFF Switch, POWER SUPPLY, and POWER CORD SOCKET)

5. There are two cords coming
out of the power supply box.
Plug the power supply cord
into an electrical outlet and
plug the other cord into the
power cord socket on the side
of the VIC. NOTE: The power
supply remains "on" while
plugged in so you should
unplug it when not in use. (Diagram of REAR VIEW OF THE VIC showing VIDEO PORT)

6. Connect the video cable to
the back of the VIC and to the
RF Modulator box, as shown.
Make sure to connect it to the
video port and not to the 6-pin
serial port, which is next to it. (Diagram of VIDEO PLUG VIDEO CABLE and RF MODULATOR)

7. Connect the RF Modulator to
your television set. For this
you'll need a screwdriver. The
short TV connector cord runs
from the RF Modulator box to
the 2 VHF Antenna leads on
the back of your television.
Simply connect the two wires
to the VHF leads and tighten
the screws firmly." (Diagram of RF MODULATOR, CONNECT WIRE LEADS TO ANTENNA LEADS ON YOUR TV SET and REAR VIEW OF TV SET showing VHF terminals)

8. Turn on the TV set.

footnote: Some VICs are provided wiht a "switchbox" which attaches between the RF modulator and TV set
The switchbox contains a switch with settings for "computer" and "TV" and should be set to "computer"
when using the VIC

TROUBLESHOOTING CHART

SYMPTOM CAUSE REMEDY

NO PICTURE (POWER LIGHT OFF)
	- VIC not "on"
		Make sure power switch is in "on" position
	- VIC not plugged in
		Check power socket next to power switch
	- Power supply not plugged tn
		Check connection with wall outlet
	- Bad fuse in VIC
		Take VIC to your Authorized Commodore Service Center for replacement of fuse*

NO PICTURE (POWER LIGHT ON) (Try turning VIC off far a few secondsh then back on)
	- TV on wrong channel
		Check Channel 3 & 4 for picture
	- Incorrect hookup
		VIC hooks up to "VHF" terminals on TV
	- Modulator not plugged in
		Check connection at 5-pin Video Port
	- Modulator on wrong channel
		Flip switch on Modulator
	- Video cable not connected
		Check connection on modulator

PICTURE WITHOUT COLOR (TRY TV & MODULATOR ON CHANNEL 3 & 4)
	- Poorly tuned TV
		RetuneTV
PICTURE WITH POOR COLOR 
	- Bad color adjustment on TV (see "picture without color")
		Adjust color/hue/brightness controls on TV
PICTURE WITH EXCESS BACKGROUND NOJSE
	- TV volume is up too high (see "picture without color")
		Adjust volume of TV
PICTURE OK, BUT NO SOUND
	- TV volume too low

9. Turn on the VIC (the red
power light on the top of the
computer should come on). If
the power light does nol.
consult the accompanying
troubleshooting chart.

10. There is a switch on the RF
Modulator for selecting either
Channel 3 or 4. Choose the
channel with the weaker
reception in your area+ and set
both the TV and the
Modulator to lhat channel.
The fine tuning on your
television may need some
adjustment.

Here is what you should see
on the screen — sometimes it
takes a second or two lo
activate. If you don't get the
following display on your
screen, turn the computer off,
wait a few seconds and turn it
on again. (Screen diagram showing "****======**** BYTES FREE and a blinking cursor on a new line")

11. Adjusting the color and
tint/hue depends on the color
controls provided on your
television set — naturally,
sets with better controls yield
better color. Some sets show
some colors better than
others.

10. If you have trouble with any of
these steps, consult the
accompanying
troubleshooting chart.

NOW...you are ready to start using the VIC.

NOTE: You can use a monitor instead of a television set — in which case you
can go directly from the VIC to the monitor cable, without the RF
Modulator.

RUN [RETURN]

(In bubble with arrow pointing to line 1)
This line tells
the VIC to print
what's between the
quotation marks.

(In bubble with arrow pointing to line 2)
This line tells the VIC
to go back to Line 1
and print it again.

(In bubble with arrow pointing to line 3)
Typing the word RUN

GETTING STARTED—
EXPERIMENT A LITTLE

You made it! Your VIC is aglow with color and ready for you
to tell it what to do. The dark blue, blinking rectangle, called
the cursor, is a signal from the ViC that it is waiting for you.

(Diagram of screen showing "**** CBM BASIC V2 **** 3583 BYTES FREE READ. []")

(In bubble pointing to cursor)
The VIC is saying it's ready

VIC TIP:
If you type a character on the screen that you don't want, press the
 [INST/DEL] key.
This key will erase the character immediately to the left of the blink
ing cursor.
Use this key as often as you like to delete unwanted characters.

Now, on with the tour! Begin by pressing the following keys:
[P][R][I][N][T]

See how the cursor moves over one position every time you
press a key? The cursor tells you where the next character is
going to appear on the screen. OK, now find the SHIFT key, it
looks like this:
 [SHIFT]
There are two of them, both the same

- PAGE 3 - 

Hold the [SHIFT] key down, and while it is being held.
press:
[2]

You can release the [SHIFT] key alter you press the [2] key.
The screen should look like this:


*** CSM BASIC V2 ***
3583 BYTES FREE
READY.
PRINT" []  

(In bubble pointing to the cursor)
you typed this

Pressing the [2] key while holding down the [SHIFT]
key caused the quotation mark to appear on the screen. *
Let's continue. Now press the following keys:
[R][A][I][N][B][O][W]

Finally, hold down the [SHIFT] key, and press the [2]
key once again. The screen
now shows:

CBM BASIC V2
3583 BYTES FREE .
READY,
PRINT "RAINBOW"

(In bubble pointing to the PRINT line)
Everything you typed is on this line.

Footnote: Note: if the number 2 appeared on the screen instead of the
" sign, you didn't hold down the shift key. Hit the [INST/DEL]
once to erase the 2 and try again.

Good morning VIC. Your mission (and we know you are going
to accept it) is to perform miracles whenever we touch just a
few keys!

Yes, your VIC is ready, able and willing to respond to your
touch like no other computer ever made. So let's buckle down
to some non-stop fun!

Hold down the [SHIFT] key and press the [CLR/HOME] key.
Type the following keys:

[N][E][W] and press the 
[RETURN] key.

1INPUT (This is the number one, not the "L")
"WHAT'S YOUR  (Press the space bar, not the letters)
NAME";A$ (Don't forget the ; semicolon!)
and press the [RETURN] key. 

2PRINT"HI, "A$
and the [RETURN] key.
3GOTO2 and the [RETURN] key.
Now press [R][U][N] and [RETURN]

- PAGE 83 - 

And the VIC responds:

(Diagram of a screen showing the typed program, the run command and the text "WHAT's YOUR NAME?")

(Bubble of text pointing to the input prompt)
Notice that
the computer
automatically
adds the question^
mark (?) to show ^
you that it's
waiting for
an input.

At which point you type in the customary response or if your
name happens to be VIC you can type:
[V][I][V] and [RETURN]

And whoopee! Your name splashed all over the screen! To
slow down the show just press the [CTRL] key. When you
are ready to leave stardom behind, press the [RUN/STOP] key.
To enter another name just type RUN and you will see the
same _prompt_ again. The _prompt_ in this case is:
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

Prompts are questions directed to you in an effort to get in-
formation into the VIC. The VIC has a limited number of ways
to get information from the human world. Perhaps the most
useful method for the computer to collect information from
our keyboard is the INPUT statement. Let's go through the
steps of our program. Here's what we told VIC to do:

First, display the message "WHAT'S YOUR NAME" on the
screen and then wait for you to put in (or INPUT) characters
from the keyboard. Take the response and name it "A$". In
our example "VIC" becomes A$. This is a kind of shorthand
for the computer.

Second, print the word "HI" followed by whatever was typed
at the keyboard. In our example we print HI VIC.
